- Description of the project:

In the home banking we are going to be able to enter with security by user and visualize
our balance. We will also be able to make transactions to other cards.

With predefined cards for already created users, we will be able to transfer silver from
account to account with sufficient security and validations so that there will be no losses.
of money in transactions.

- Client requirements/features:

 --Users are already created, there is no registration, only login with card number and pin.

 --The user can view his current balance, a list of last transactions of the month,
and will be able to make new transactions.

 --The user can have more than one card.

 --To make a transaction, the other user's card number and amount will be requested.
